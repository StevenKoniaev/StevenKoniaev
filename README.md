Hello there! My name is Steven Koniaev.

My website and resume: https://stevenkoniaev.github.io/

I am currently a student at Mcgill University and in pursuit of my degree. If you would like to collaborate on any projects please let me know! There is more information about myself on my website. 

I am currently learning about AI and computer vision on my own and hope to create some projects about it. I also am always making some side projects such as more Unity games.
